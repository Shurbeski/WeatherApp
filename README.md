# WeatherApp
Android Weather application, during the quarantine I took Android Development course on Udacity, I was practicing on two applications, the one was during the classes and on this one (the Weather Application), I was implementing all the things I have learned in the lessons. With help of the Udacity teachers, that gave me starter code I managed to build this app. During this course I learned a lot and I would like to continue practicing the things I have learned on the course during some intership, and also learn a lot more about Android and how is like to be Android Developer
